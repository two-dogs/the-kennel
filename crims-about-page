Each of our scripts will do the following:

01 Insure pastebinit is installed, if data is required for assistance

02 Insure inxi is updated, if used for obtaining data. You will always see the -z flag used with inxi which makes absolute certain no MAC addresses, IP addresses, usernames, or hostnames are included in the output (guarantees privacy).

03 Backup any manipulated files using .bkup as an extention

04 Not delete itself, as they might be needed again during the resolution process. Some have requested the scripts delete themselves. However, if the script needs to create a middle-man file as a placeholder of data as it is being formatted, the script will delete that file.

05 Automatically upload collected data from the diagnostics commands to pastebin.com and you need to share the link with whomever is lending assistance to you.

06 Be developed in plain-sight. We discuss and share during the creation process of these scripts in #linuxmint-chat and you're welcome to contribute!

Our scripts are open source. Obviously you can see what is going to be run which are the same commands you would otherwise be asked to enter into a terminal in order to help us help you. We have combined these commonly requested bits into clean scripts to make life easier for everyone involved.
